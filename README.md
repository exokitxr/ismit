## Why

The most common structure in open source software is a lone developer working a volunteer side job out of passion for the cause.

The majority of users, especially companies, copy-paste open source code under a permissive license and occasionally request bugfixes and features from the developer. Larger open source projects are funded by companies, but the dynamic remains -- a couple of developers justifying open source to their employer.

This works until the developer burns out or needs to attend to their "real job" instead, at which point users feel abandoned, and the developer is held irresponsible.

This license breaks the cycle by aligning developer and user incentives. Everyone gets the liberty they expect from their software. Where this liberty burdens the maintainer with responsibility -- code changes -- that responsibility is shared in the form of a sponsorship.

If it doesn't work out, no problem! Sponsors keep the permissive license for their copy of the code -- including the right to fork and re-release the software.

In the meantime, the developer has a reason to maintain the software users want. Companies have a line item to expense for the software they use.

## FAQ

#### Can I use the code for free?

Yes, for any purpose, as long as you don't change it. To change it, you need the MIT License.

#### How does this license affect me?

It probably doesn't. Most use cases just import and run the code somewhere; the license explicitly allows that.

If you are a company looking to reshape the code into your product, you might want to sponsor a permissive MIT License.

#### Can I use the code in a closed source project?

Yes, keeping in mind the rest of the terms.

#### Can I dynamically load this code from its web location?

Yes.

#### Can I use part of the code in my project?

Yes, as long as you don't change it. To change it, you need the MIT License.

#### Can I post this code elsewhere?

Yes, without changes. If you are making changes, you need the MIT License.

#### Can I use an older version of the code?

Yes, if that version of the code came with this license.

#### Can I look at the code and re-implement it for free?

No, that would be deriving a modified version. The MIT License allows this, of course.

#### Do sponsors get the "full" MIT License?

Yes, the text is literally the MIT License.

#### Can I get the MIT License and then release the code for free?

Yes -- the MIT License says you can!

#### If I cancel my sponsorship do I get to keep the MIT License?

Yes, but the MIT License applies to the version of the code you got while you were a sponsor only.

#### What happens if the software is abandoned?

Nothing, you get to keep any license you have. You might be less inclined to sponsor the software in that case.
