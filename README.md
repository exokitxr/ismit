## Why

The most common structure in open source software is a lone developer working a side job for free, out of passion for the project. The vast majority of users, especially companies, copy-paste open source code under a permissive license and occasionally request bugfixes and features from the developer.

This works until the developer burns out or needs to attend to their "real job", at which point users feel abandoned, and the developer is held irresponsible.

This license breaks the cycle by aligning developer and user incentives. Everyone gets the liberty they expect from their software, and where this liberty burdens the developer with maintenance responsibility -- code changes -- the responsibility is shared with the user in the form of sponsorship.

If it doesn't work out, no problem! Sponsors keep their license for their copy of the code. The developer has a reason to maintain the software users want.
